# What's Here?

- [plotly_demo_IDEAS.ipynb](plotly_demo_IDEAS.ipynb)
A Jupyter Notebook (+RISE / reveal.js presentation) used as a short tutorial for using Plotly's Python graphing library. This was presented in a visualization course at Northwestern University as part of the Integrated Data-Driven Discovery in Earth and Astrophysical Sciences (IDEAS) data science program. Final projects of the course can be found here: https://www.ideas.ciera.northwestern.edu/focus-summer-school/visualizations-projects-2019/

A YML file is available to create a conda environment that can run the Plotly demo: [environment.yml](environment.yml).

- [d1_trajectory_theory.pdf](d1_trajectory_theory.pdf)
A short programming prompt given to an undergraduate student I mentored in 2020-2022. This writing sample does not include a tutorial, but gives a better picture of my technical writing style.
